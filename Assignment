On October 15, 2016, college quarterback Pass Litening threw seven consecutive completed passes in one game – a team record. During this game, he completed 21 of 28 passes. Did this streak of seven consecutive completions suggest that Litening had a “hot hand” that day, or was it simply a result of chance? Using the given random digit table, describe and conduct a simulation of 100 trials to test the likelihood of seven consecutive completions in a game in which 21 of 28 passes were completed. Based on your simulation, state an appropriate conclusion.
